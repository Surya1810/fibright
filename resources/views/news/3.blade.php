            <p>This is the 3rd year that SEforALL, with the support of the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet
                (GEAPP) and other sponsors, will host a pavilion at COP. </p>
            <p>The SDG7 Global South Pavilion will be the main hub at COP28 for discussing and showcasing how to unite
                global efforts on energy, climate and development. Under the theme of “Forward Together”, this year, our
                focus is on bringing together governments, partners, and other stakeholders from developing regions; uniting
                those who require resources to transition equitably with those who have an interest in the opportunities the
                transition presents.</p>
            <p>Our cross-cutting themes this year revolve around inclusion, finance and innovation.</p>
            <p>We plan to host global leaders, including Heads of State, in engaging sessions covering topics of utmost
                importance to a just and equitable energy transition.</p>
            <p>The SDG7 Global South Pavilion is located in the Blue Zone at COP28 and accessible to everyone with
                accreditation for this area. The sessions will also be streamed live to a global audience.</p>
